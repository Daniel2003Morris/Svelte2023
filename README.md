This project is about the space-based mmo elite dangerous.
It relies svelte, github gist, and node.js to work.
It is written in javascript, html, css, and svelte.
The following commands need to be used in order to access the project: npm install, npm run dev.
There are multiple bugs in the code those being:
Green spaces show unfitted or missing content.
I cannot access the second item of the news array making it unusable for foreach loops.

If I could have I would have wanted to:
Add content to other pages.
Add and access other information in the custom API.
Use other APIs for different information.
Add a ship loadout customizer.
